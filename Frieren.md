I was never one to care about anime or tv shows in general. Losing focus or interest as nothing really connected with me.

At least until I found frieren: beyond journey's end. The most beautiful, saddest thing i had ever seen until now and probably will ever.

The story of that little elf losing the people she loves and only realizing what she lost when its too late really resonated with me. From the very first episode i found myself hooked with tears in my eyes. There is so much going on in this anime to truly say what goes on in details but seeing her trying to find pleasure in little things that mattered to those she loved really hit me.

I've been obsessed with it ever since i watched it. Hoping i would one day wake up in a world similar to hers. A world where i could roam free of the burden that time is. Able to heal slowly over eternity and see the beauty in the world the same way she does.

Alas this is the real world and i instead found myself deep in inner thoughts and questions. Lacking a true purpose in life i am but a former shell of who i once was.

While my story might not have a happy turn it made me who i am and this is my story.
