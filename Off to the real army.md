After basic training i had to wait for a course to go learn my trade (artillery).

During that period of time the bullying truly started again.
I was alone surrounded by what id call cunts that didnt grow up from highschool. Needing to feel superior to everyone by pushing everyone down.

It definitely wasnt the teamwork i was hoping the army would be.

I had people throw stuff at me, sabotage me to look better and constantly being humiliated or laughed at for my poor performance.

on the more extreme side i had people piss on my gear..

Then came 1 guy from the reserve. A bit older than me by 5 ish years he was a bodybuilding in his civilian time. He took me under him and made me train which gave me a sense of purpose and actually alleviated the depression a bit especially considering no one dared to mess with him (nor me while i was around him).

The trade courses themselves were fine but definitely hard.
Then i was off to my unit... [[Hell]]
