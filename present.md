Now here i am. 30 years old. Unloved. Alone with my dog.

I've been content of my situation, not having to work, getting paid by the veterans affair and simply staying home.

Moved back with my parents to save money and get a better diet.

Disconnected from the world i am bound to find no one to share the rest of my life with as i shut myself from the world.

Friends living across the world from me and in different time zones there comes times where i consider myself friendless. I do my best to be there but contact with them is sometimes rare making me even more so alone.

The other day i did the mistake of watching the most beautiful piece of media ive ever seen.
