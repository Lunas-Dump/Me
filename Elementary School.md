Year 2 - 6 was a bit harder for me.  School was easy to me except french (a recurring theme in my school life). Where i struggled the most was with the other kids.  I had made myself a friend and i had my cousin going to the same school but it was all i had for the entire period.

Thats also when i started getting bullied by some kids. Maybe it was because i was good in school and they thought of me as a nerd. maybe it was my look. Im not really sure what i did to deserve it but i know i was at the center of their comments and looks. I learned to stay away and to take care of myself and no one else. The more i tried to be a normal kid the more it seemed like i would be laughed at. A loner surrounded by idiot is how i would have described myself back then. All ive really wanted was to be like the others. Play with them, make friends, be invited to birthday parties... just like the others. Instead i rode my back quietly through town, went to the library or sat down at a park waiting for the evening to go back home.

My mom always asking me how school was.. how could i have answered anything but "okay".. its not like she could've forced anyone to be friends with me.. thats not how the real world work after all.

For all these years i just pushed through having a single real friend and my cousin around. Occasionally other "rejects" would hang out with me. i still was doing my best to be the happy laughing guy i truly am.. just alone. 

The [[occult]] always was an interesting aspect of life to me. To think we could be linked to the afterlife was always fascinating to read about. Let's continue in that chapter for now.
