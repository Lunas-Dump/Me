Hell.. also called 4th regiment.. a small unit based in gagetown.
Its pretty much where dreams go to die.

The unit itself was in new brunswick so most people only spoke english. My english was fine but definitely nothing crazy when compared to today.

The start was fine now but i found myself back alone with the people that would bully me. The bodybuilder was sent to another unit so the only other person i had that was somewhat okay with me was another guy we used to train with.

Thing took another turn for the worse during a coms training. Learning how radio operated and what not was fun. at the end of the course however we were playing sport before going back to our regular training with our units.

We played baseball that day. Having played baseball before i was excited since it was something i knew i was good at and enjoyed. My turn on the bat came and as i swung ***pop*** here goes my shoulder. Completely dislocated. It went from being where it normally rest to being in the middle of my back above my shoulder blade.

I put it back into place myself and filled for an injury report.
People at my unit seemed unconvinced that i could have possible dislocated my shoulder and put it back into place without fainting.. apparently my injury wasnt big enough to be serious... 
But through the following months it just kept happening over and over again. Sometimes dislocating while doing nothing.

The doctors had put me into light work which made everyone hate me as they had to pick up my slack while still thinking i was faking an injury.
Time progressed and it got worse requiring surgery which only increased the amount of time i had to be in restriction.

People started to get fed up and decided to turn me into their punching bag. Going from subtle bullying to not get caught to pushing me, punching me and having higher ups even join in.

Reporting it did nothing which only made me feel worse. Turning into a deep depression which in turn resulted in more restrictions when the psychiatrist saw i was cutting myself (once again a fallback to feel something once more).

Many cocktails of pills later i was almost unable to wake up in the morning feeling like a zombie. The pills made me feel almost stuck feeling depressed since it numbed any kind of feelings i could have been experiencing.

Seeing i was in fact not getting better i was released from the army a few months later.
Before getting out i decided to stop all of the pills i was on and instead got myself a cannabis license (it being not legal outside medical reason yet). I was once again able to laugh and wake up in the morning.
Following that i moved with a girl i had met during my time in gagetown to her hometown of London ontario.

Everything seemed right, we had fun together and loved each other. I was however much more careful around strangers, feeling a sense of unease in public which only seemed to get worse as time moved on.

I proposed to her after 2 years living with her. She was making me a better person by forcing me out and into the world so it seemed fitting to want to spend my life with her.

3 years after proposing to her, one morning, she decided she didnt love me anymore and wanted to explore more options she had. I still think it was due to my issues and slowing her down since she wanted to have fun and go out and i just wanted to stay home and hide from the world. But who knows.
