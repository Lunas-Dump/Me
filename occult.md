I remember when i was about 7 or so i started seeing things others were not able to see.
It had started with auras as i watched people i would focus beyond them as if trying to see inside of them instead of the surface of their body. Thats how it started anyway. A faint glow of color surrounding someone. It wasnt scarring me it seemed more so intriguing than anything.

I remember sometimes seeing a glow around people as if other people were standing there with them.  it was beautiful but i couldnt just tell people about it, easy way to get called a freak even more than normal. I told my mom at the time which she seemed supportive about it.

I also remember the house i was living in.. a scary place for someone who can see more than the eyes lets you.  There was a constant dark figure in my bedroom, looking at me constantly as i played. My stuffed animals at night seemed to always all stare at me with him. Many nightmares happened with that. If only it stopped at that.

When going in the bathroom there was a window right in front of the door as you went in. To the left a large mirror. In the reflections of the window and the mirror i was never alone in this bathroom. A man reflecting as if behind me. A small girl standing still and starring. It was always one of these two. I started to be scared to shower or use the bathroom. My hygiene at the time only contributed to people laughing at me. Its not like i could explain to anyone. I tried explaining to my parents but nothing much changed.

The worst time was one day when i was doing my homework on the kitchen table. behind me was a counter with no room to walk there. Past the counter was a wall and past that was the bathroom.
I was just minding my business doing my homework and i heard someone say my name.
Even to this day just thinking about it gives me chill. I could feel his breath on my right ear as if he would have softly said it from mere inches away. I dont think i had ever been this scared before. i was paralyzed in fear. It took nearly an hour and a half for my parents to come home from work. All they saw was their boy tear in the eyes unable to move at the kitchen table until they talked to me. I doubt my parents believed what happened to me that day but i know it was as real as anything else.

Most of my elementary school days were uneventful other than what i talked about. Then we [[moved again]]. Yet another new place.
