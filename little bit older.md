Most of my actually memories comes from when i was in elementary school tho.
Obviously a bit older now at 6-7 years old. I moved from the big city with my family to be closer to my dad's side of the family.
People i had before hand not met or at least didnt remember meeting until then. Some had semblant of familiarity looking back to it but i cant recall meeting them before so it must have been when i was really young.

School was strange. Definitely not what i pictured when i was younger. I remember getting grabbed and having stuff stolen from me by some bigger kid back then. it wasnt a common occurrence but it happened once or twice.  Thats also when i made my first real friend. She was the same age as me but her name is lost to time sadly. I vaguely remember her face she was always smiling and so kind but also extremely shy just like me. The year after i had to change school since my parents moved yet again. Ive never seen her since.

[[Elementary School]] at the new place was when i had my first semblant of steady housing. Staying there until i entered high school.
