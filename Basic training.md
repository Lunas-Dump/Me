Basic training started the year after i left shcool. The basic itself was not too bad although very similar to highschool.

We were all in the same boat so people werent really bullying but i definitely found myself alone often.

I injured myself multiple time throughout this time which only slowed down my graduation.
In a sense it was a good thing as i got more and more in shape from it.

The basic itself was hard but fair. Not much happened during that period.
then i graduated [[Off to the real army]]
