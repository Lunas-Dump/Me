I have vague memories of when i was extremely young..

the earliest i can remember is probably when i was 4 or 5.
its not so much a memory as it is a feeling.. we were in montreal and i was walking around with my mom.. everything seemed so big and impressive. buildings were so tall and filled with mystery.
I remember a school that had a big tower similarly to how you'd see in anime or movies.
the kids which at the time seemed like grown ups to me playing outside and having fun.

another memory i have while young was playing duck hunt. i cant recall much of that time so im not sure how old i was but i remember my mom watching me play in the living room. everything seemed so easy back then.

I dont recall much of my siblings back then. i do recall a bunch of fighting between my parents tho.
they used to fight a lot back then. looking back on it, it was most likely due to lack of money. for a while we had to live at my grandma's place. my sister, mom and myself. i was scared back then my mom kept telling me to run if my dad was coming near me while i was out playing.

This didnt last luckily. For a time we actually seemed like a normal family. but we did have to move a lot back then. we would move nearly every year up until when i entered elementary school. But thats further than this takes place so lets not rush ahead too much.

We used to see my cousins a lot, being an extremely close family. I still remember christmas back then. We would all get together around noon and we'd all be having fun together about 20-50 people in the same small apartment. Food, drinks, the adult playing cards in the kitchen while the children would watch movies or play with their new toys.

My parents always thought me to be kind and honest with people. Even if they might not like the truth. My mom made it clear to always speak my mind and not to be scared of the opinions others might have of me good or bad.

I miss those days. I however grew a [[little bit older]]
