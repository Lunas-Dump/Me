I was deeply depressed at the time i reached my 4th year of high school.
having thoughts of suicide...

Not having told anyone how i truly felt deep down at the time everything seemed to be too much for me. I remember one afternoon after school i was home alone (my parents still working) and i went to the kitchen and grabbed a chef's knife and put it to my throat.

I was decided not to suffer further.. after all one quick slit and it would all be over. The knife was pressed against me almost ready to cut through my throat. It started to sting from the pressure all i had left to do is cut. and as i was getting ready the phone rang...

a wrong number...

A man looking for an old friend. I dont know if he could feel pain in my voice or if he just was overly polite but he talked to me about nascar which i assume is what he was trying to talk about to his friend. he talked to me for nearly 20 minutes about stuff he's passionate about.. My parents being almost home i put the knife back down and hang up the phone.

Not a day goes by i dont wish i could tell him thank you. Without him i'd probably be dead today. Was he my guardian angel or just a real wrong number ill never know but i know the story would've ended much sooner without him. I hope he found peace wherever he is today.

Thats when i opened up about my feeling to my dear friend. She recommended the school psychologist. At the time it seemed like a sensible idea so i went for it.
The psychologist was a real joke. I had asked her to keep it confidential. I showed her my cuts having talked to her about it and she betrayed my trust.

She called my parents and explained what i had told her and what i had done to myself.
I remember my mom sitting in my room crying trying to understand what was going on with me.
then she turned it to talking about how scars are permanent and ugly and to not do it more. she also blamed herself for it.. as if it was her fault...

The next year i stopped school. wanting to get as far away as possible from it i decided to join the army as soon as i could.
