This time in a further city i didnt see the 1 friend i had as much as i used to after that.
Highschool came and i was in a new school. This time with people i previously had known from the elementary school. It also brought new people but for the majority what was in elementary remained the same in high school. i was a nobody and no-one really liked.

My friend was in a different class, my cousin was in a different school, i was alone again.
I was part of the cadets at that point so there was some people that truly knew me so i had a bit more people talking to me. But overall i hanged out by myself.


The bullying only got worse, attack became more personal and people cared less about me than before (a part from the few). by the time i was in my 3rd year you could say i was depressed.
Not knowing how to cope with the stress of school and the constant bullying i resorted to cutting myself as a way of feeling something.. anything.. I wasnt ready to how addictive it would be however. While no going too deeps it sure left marks that i still bare today. I was laughed at during PE when people saw them. Not once did someone try to help during that time.

I had resorted to hanging out with other people around the same time i started cutting.
3 of them seemed to care but looking back i believe only 1 actually cared truly about me.
Marie-pier.. my first real crush. There is nothing i wouldn't have done for her.
Our friendship was genuine but i couldnt bring myself to tell her how i truly felt.
She seemed so far off my league. Why would a beauty like her care about a loser like me. I think she knew deep down but i never openly opened up about my feelings towards her.
Even to this day im filled with regrets towards the missed opportunity.

We hanged out and talked a bunch from my 3rd to 4th year. She was the one person who told me to see the school psychologist.. which i did. A choice i would come to regret.
