After our separation she left me with almost everything including one of the dog we had acquired together. Aniah my beautiful little girl. Without my dog i must say i would have probably ended things shortly after. Seeing no points in living or doing anything at that time the only thing that kept me going is my dog's dependance on me. Not wanting to hurt her I have since forced myself day after day to make sure she didn't need anything.

After being released from the army i noticed my depression leaving slowly but surely. What i wasnt expecting however was the sheer amount of anxiety that would replace that feeling.

Having panic attack nearly every time i go outside is truly difficult. I had changed my diet from normal every day food to ordering food everyday to not have to face anyone or step foot in public.
Since every time i went outside i was rushed feeling as if at any point someone would come out of nowhere to hit me or that i was gonna get made fun of by some people and everyone would join in. Kinda funny how my parents made sure to tell me never to care about what people say and in the end its my inability to distance myself from those comments that turned me into who i am..

I went from a little boy that loved to laugh and thought the world to be a gigantic beautiful thing to a scary dark place filled with nothing but hatred.
I still try to be funny and laugh but deep down im still just scared of everything and everyone. Lacking true motivation in life the only thing i do is sit here waiting for my time to eventually come.
